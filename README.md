## Project description
This little credit score job seeks to find the best model that can assess whether the customer is a good or a bad creditor. In this project, three different logistic regression methods, xgboost and random forests were tested. Before applying any model, a data analysis, cleaning and a descriptive analysis were performed, then work was carried out with zip codes to place the weight in the appropriate place for the model and also the balance of the data between bad and good payers.
